<synopsis>
Magic&mdash;A century has passed since this concept has been recognized as a formal technology instead of the product of the occult or folklore.<br /> <br /> The season is spring and it is time for a brand new school year.<br /> <br /> At the National Magic University First Affiliate High School, a.k.a. Magic High School, students are divided into two distinct groups according to their academic performances. The &quot;Bloom,&quot; who demonstrate the highest grades and are enrolled in the &quot;First Course,&quot; and the &quot;Weed,&quot; who have a poor academic record and are enrolled in the &quot;Second Course.&quot;<br /> <br /> This spring, a very peculiar brother and sister enroll as new students. The brother is an under achiever with some deficiencies and enrolls as a &quot;Weed,&quot; while his younger sister is an honor student, who enrolls as a &quot;Bloom.&quot; The brother, with a somewhat philosophical expression, and the younger sister who holds feelings a little stronger than sibling love for him... Ever since these two have entered through the gates of this prestigious school, the calm campus was beginning to change...<br /> <br /> (Source: Aniplex USA)
