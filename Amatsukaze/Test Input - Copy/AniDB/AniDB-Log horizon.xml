This anime series offered a decent cut of action, political intrigue, and character development. I am looking forward to the next season! Whoever enjoys anime of this type will not be disappointed!
</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="129243">
For those who always did wonder "Could [url=http://anidb.net/a8692]Sword Arts Online[/url] have done better?" or even for those who watched [url=http://anidb.net/a9287]Maoyuu Maoh Yuusha[/url] and wanted some improvements. Great series if you`re fan of series such as [url=http://anidb.net/a311]Guru Guru[/url]. And it`s not mopy as .Hack either. But if you`re against the whole RPG subgenre in your anime, tread with caution.

<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="579724">Best anime of the season!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="95663">
Steers clear of Sword Art Online`s survival theme and places more focus on the MMO portion of MMORPGs. Highly recommended show for longtime MMO gamers.
</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="602896">
The start was already promising and kept me watching. Now at almost half time I must say that this is an awesome anime that is well worth watching. I am not a big gamer, but the script is well thought out, the characters likabely and the art is nice. Definitely worth your time!
</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="78827">
Great fun series with a lot more going on than at first appears. Excellent OP and ED too.
</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="106205">
This is a MMORPG anime should be. Very best realistic setting, good story telling, characters are likeable and fun to watch. Story still ongoing, so I cannot judge it now. Next season is definitely on my looking forward list.
</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="39500">
A unique twist to the age old virtual world. How to survive a virtual world in the long term, instead of just accomplishing a game in order to survive and return to the real world. Its like "The Walking Dead" show but about virtual reality.
</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="99271">
I was skeptic at first, but it turned out to be a pretty good gaming anime. It does go into a bit too much detail about obvious things, but I find myself just laughing it away and enjoying it and just waiting for more to come. Definitely for gamers!
</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="81270">This show is mazing for any mmo fan</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="28484">
This is actually a pretty good tackle to the gamekakushi genre, change the world with capitalism and politics.
</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="441125">
One of the best animes set in MMORPG world. Quite enjoyable,with lots of humor and adventures. The only down side are the first 5 episodes, which are more slow paced and look somewhat random at first watch.
</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="217568">
The most consistent presentation of "stuck in MMO game reality" so far. While not as flashy as others, Log Horizon has big potential. Generally nice characters with some really good ones, best world/reality in its subgenre, great concept and story ... give it a try.
</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="4913">
Underrated this at first. Probably due to SAO keeping all attention. This is completely not SAO based or related, and has a completely different setup. Overall, it is nice and likable. Not as much as SAO, but totally worth watching.
</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="31111">
Must see for any fantasy or video game fan. A nice take on the stuck in a game genre that not so depressing as the SOA & .hack// series are, and put a different spin on the genre then those two. I`ve actual re-watched it a quite a few times already. Only bad part was the nostalgia I kept getting for the good old days.
</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="618709">
This anime is a masterpiece. It leaves you with a really good feeling, and is totally refreshing. The story is great, and well executed. The friendliness and sudden dark elements are really dynamic and welcomed. This is one of the really good anime I`ve seen recently :)
</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="308191">
I found it way more interesting then SOA, so yeah definitely a must watch in the genre it`s in. I saw SOA first and would rate it a 7.5/10 I would rate LH 8.5/10 just because the characters are more diverse and interesting, while the story line is more mature and less drama-ish.
</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="155853">
Log Horizon is surprisingly good. In fact it shapes up to be the best anime consering a virtual MMORPG world. The writing is spot on when it comes to the transition of a game world into reality and it quickly moves into politics and commerce.
</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="53032">
In some ways what Maoyuu could have been (if only it had been given enough episodes to properly convey its original world and story in sufficient depth), and in other ways what SAO could only ever dream of wishing to be (in terms of consistent story, world building, and character developments)... Log Horizon is easily one of the best anime series of 2013, and appears to continue to be so for the first half of 2014 at the very least.

<name>sword</name>
<description>
A sword is a long, edged piece of metal, used as a cutting, thrusting, and clubbing weapon in many civilizations throughout the world. Before firearms became commonplace, and fast enough to render other weapons pointless in the battlefield, they were the main kind of weapon for war and duels alike. A sword fundamentally consists of a blade and a hilt, typically with one or two edges for striking and cutting, and a point for thrusting. That aside, however, they may come in all sorts of designs: the medieval European swords used to be big, heavy weapons that did not actually cut but instead broke the enemy`s bones under their armor; conversely, the Chinese jian sword (called "ken" in Japanese) attempted to exploit the armor`s joints and perforate the enemy`s flesh in those places, but was useless against the armor itself, and did not take the strikes, preferring to redirect them, to this day being considered a highly "circular" weapon and associated to taijiquan; on the other hand, the Japanese katana was a balanced all-purposes weapon that could be used even in an axe-like way, but which a master swordsman could use in many other, more elaborate manners.

A ninja was a covert agent or mercenary of feudal Japan specializing in unorthodox arts of war. The functions of the ninja included espionage, sabotage, infiltration, and assassination, as well as open combat in certain situations. The ninja, using covert methods of waging war, were contrasted with the samurai, who had strict rules about honor and combat.

<description>
Some of the central structural elements in anime are: Plot Continuity How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters? Stereotype Characters Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists. Plot Twists Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.

<name>target audience</name>
<description>
Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment. The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.

<description>
Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>
"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR" If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice. It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE. A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime. [Source: TV Tropes]

A fantasy world is a type of imaginary world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to magic or magical abilities and a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography and sociology, and also on folklore.

<description>
The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.

Tokyo, as real-world location is the backdrop of this anime. Tokyo (東京 Tōkyō, "Eastern Capital") is one of the 47 prefectures of Japan. Tokyo is the capital of Japan, the centre of the Greater Tokyo Area, and the largest metropolitan area of the world. It is the seat of the Japanese government and the Imperial Palace, and the home of the Japanese Imperial Family. Tokyo is in the Kantou region on the south-eastern side of the main island Honshu and includes the Izu Islands and Ogasawara Islands. Tokyo Metropolis was formed in 1943 from the merger of the former Tokyo Prefecture (東京府 Tōkyō-fu) and the city of Tokyo (東京市 Tōkyō-shi). (Source: Wikipedia)

<description>
Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction). In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today. Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture Source: Wiki

<name>adventure</name>
<description>
Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.

<description>
Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results. These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events. A comedy anime is laced with humour and sets out to provoke laughter from the audience. Japanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.

<name>post-apocalypse</name>
<description>
An anime that takes place on future Earth (or it could be an alternative universe) after a major cataclysm has occurred. World War III, an alien invasion, plague, global warming or some other general disaster are common themes to build a post-apocalyptic world upon, where the effects were severe enough that mankind barely survived. The time frame may be immediately after the catastrophe, focusing on the travails or psychology of survivors, or considerably later, often including the theme that the existence of pre-catastrophe civilization has been forgotten (or mythologised). Post-apocalyptic stories often take place in an agrarian, non-technological future world, or a world where only scattered elements of technology remain. There is a considerable degree of blurring between post-apocalyptic fiction and that which deals with false utopias or dystopian societies.

<name>war</name>
<description>
War is a phenomenon of organized violent conflict, typified by extreme aggression, societal disruption and adaptation, and high mortality. The objective of warfare differs in accord with a group`s role in a conflict: The goals of offensive warfare are typically the submission, assimilation or destruction of another group, while the goals of defensive warfare are simply the repulsion of the offensive force and, often, survival itself. Relative to each other, combatants in warfare are called enemies. The terms military, militant, and militarism each refer to fundamental aspects of war, i.e. the organized group, the combative individual, and the supportive ethos (respectively). Source: wiki

Akihabara is an area of Tokyo, Japan. It is located less than five minutes by rail from Tokyo Station. Its name is frequently shortened to Akiba. Akihabara is a major shopping area for electronic, computer, anime, and otaku goods, including new and used items. And thus is prominently featured in many otaku-centric anime.

<description>
The anime shows elements of a `R`ole `P`laying `G`ame, either as part of a parody or because the anime is actually based on an RPG. Typical elements: When collecting items, beating opponents, or levelling up a distinct (often childishly sounding) sound cue is played. A HUD (`H`eads `U`p `D`isplay) may also be presenting in combat, showing vital player and "enemy" statistics.

A show with an ensemble cast focuses on a larger group of characters rather than on a smaller number of them. As such, it doesn`t really have a "main" or "lead" character; instead, such a show has a group of central characters, all of whom play an important part in the show`s grander scheme.

Autumn, interchangeably known as fall in the US and Canada, is one of the four temperate seasons. Autumn marks the transition from summer into winter, in September (Northern Hemisphere) or March (Southern Hemisphere), when the arrival of night becomes noticeably earlier and the temperature cools considerably. One of its main features is the shedding of leaves from deciduous trees. Source: Wikipedia

<name>season</name>
<description>
A season is a division of the year, marked by changes in weather, ecology, and hours of daylight. Seasons result from the yearly orbit of the Earth around the Sun and the tilt of the Earth`s rotational axis relative to the plane of the orbit. In temperate and polar regions, the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the Earth`s surface, variations of which may cause animals to go into hibernation or to migrate, and plants to be dormant. During May, June, and July, the northern hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the sun. The same is true of the southern hemisphere in November, December, and January. It is the tilt of the Earth that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months which increases the solar flux. However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the hottest months in the northern hemisphere and December, January, and February are the hottest months in the southern hemisphere. In temperate and subpolar regions, four calendar-based seasons (with their adjectives) are generally recognized: spring (vernal), summer (estival), autumn (autumnal), fall and winter (hibernal). Ecologists often use a six-season model for temperate climate regions that includes pre-spring (prevernal) and late summer (serotinal) as distinct seasons along with the traditional four.

<description>
Shiroe is best known as "Shiroe the Strategist" or "Villain in Glasses". His real name is Shirogane Kei. He is the founder and guild master of Log Horizon. His main class is Enchanter, which bestows him powerful support spells and allows him to aid his allies to victory instead of fighting in the frontlines. His secondary class is Scribe, which allows him to accurately draw maps of the places he visited and later allows him to develop new spells never seen before. A socially awkward engineering graduate student who has been playing Elder Tale for almost eight years, Shiroe was the strategist of the long-disbanded Debauchery Tea Party group, an informal (non-guild) elite group of players who completed high level group quests known as Raids. Shiroe had strong reservations about joining guilds until, in the aftermath of the Apocalypse and the ensuing worldwide despair, he decided to create a place for him and his friends, leading to the establishment of Log Horizon. Shiroe manages to assemble and create Akihabara`s Round Table council after performing a highly complex, long-range plan to seize control of the Guild Building in Akiba, giving him control over the players and guilds` assets.

Naotsugu is Shiroe`s best friend and was also a member of the now disbanded Debauchery Tea Party group. His real name is Hasegawa Naotsugu. His main class is "Guardian", allowing him to use heavy armor and weapons along powerful defense spells to protect him and his companions. He calls himself an "open pervert", claiming that unlike some men he doesn`t hide his perverted nature from others and is very proud of that fact. He has a tendency to get on Akatsuki`s bad side with his perverted comments and a running gag is their confrontations usually ending with him getting a knee to the face, before she asks Shiroe for permission to do it.

Before the Apocalypse he was part of a guild called "The Cat Food Guild", which was composed solely of cat people. It has since been disbanded since their house caved in due to bad weather.

Akatsuki is a beautiful Assassin within the world of Elder Tale. Her secondary class is "Tracker", which enhances her assassin skills even further with stealth and detecting abilities. She was initially acquainted with Shiroe after having partied with him to complete quests prior to the Apocalypse albeit using a male avatar. With Shiroe`s help she switches to a more accurate female avatar; despite having the appearance of a teenager, she is a college student like Shiroe. After Shiroe helps her, she starts referring to him as her "Master" and joins his party, claiming that it is out of gratitude but it is later shown that she is infatuated with him. She has a violent relationship with Naotsugu because of his "open pervertedness" and usually resorts to pre-emptive violence to stop his perverted comments before they can be spoken. Source: Wiki

Minori is a young girl trapped in the world of Elder Tale with her brother Tohya. Her class is "Kannagi", a healer dressed as a Japanese shrine maiden whose spells are focused on preventing damage and debuffs to her and her allies instead of just treating them. Minori and her brother met Shiroe on their first day playing Elder Tale and asked him questions about gaining skills and healing spells. Although Shiroe disliked when people ask him for things, after meeting them he decided to teach them about the game and even lowered his avatar`s stats so he could travel with them safely. Minori and her brother were with Shiroe when the Apocalypse began and were separated from Shiroe afterwards. Lost and without anyone to guide them, she and her brother decided to join the guild Hamelin to try to gain experience and levels, but the Hamelin guild masters exploited them (and other low level players) instead. After being rescued, Minori and her brother join Log Horizon and she starts studying Elder Tale`s game mechanics under Shiroe, in order to become a strategist like him, but later realizes that just like Akatsuki, she is in love with him. Her original secondary class is "Tailor" but she later switches it to "Apprentice", allowing her to become Shiroe`s official disciple and learn some of his skills as well. Source: Wiki

Touya is Minori`s twin brother. His class is "Samurai", capable of using heavy armor and weaponry and casting special spells to increase his performance that must be used with caution due to their long cooldown time. When Touya and his sister first met Shiroe, Touya immediately started pestering him with questions on how to gain skills. He views Shiroe as a role model due to not only his strength and knowledge, but also his cool and kind personality. While Minori is shy and gentle, Touya is very brash but it is clear he cares for his sister greatly and genuinely. Wheelchair-bound after an accident in the old world, he greatly enjoys being able to use his legs again in the world of Elder Tale. When Touya and his sister were trapped in the unethical guild Hamelin, he often wondered what Shiroe would do in that situation and tries to emulate Shiroe when faced with challenges. Once rescued by Shiroe and his friends, Touya joins Log Horizon with his sister. Source: Wiki

She is an accountant in real life and is a great asset to Shiroe`s plans due to her ability to negotiate with others, but it is not known whether her skills at cosplay in Log Horizon are the same in the old world.

<description>
Marielle is a Cleric, the rather eccentric guild master of the Crescent Moon Alliance guild (which is also part of the Round Table council) and a friend of Shiroe`s. She is stronger than she looks and has a habit of hugging people so hard she slams them into walls, and her preferred victim is Naotsugu for whom she eventually becomes infatuated. She usually does this when meeting new people or greeting a friend. However, she can be very serious when required. This holds true especially when a member of her guild is in danger. Source: Wiki

In time of Goblin King invasion, she shows prowess befitting a heiress of noble family, as (with a little help from Shiroe and Krusty) she manges to organize over 1200 adventurers to help defend Eastal. Afterwards she is nominated as Eastal ambassador in Akihabara.
