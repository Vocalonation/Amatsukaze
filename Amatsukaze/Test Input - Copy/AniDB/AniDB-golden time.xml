In the 1/4 of the story. Good romance, interesting relationships and amnesia as a wild card... or the heroine? Your choice. With the story progress, I thought it will be 12-13 episodes series at first. Looking forward to slightly unknown in the next 18 episodes.

Second half of the show goes so downhill, can`t recommend it at all. Tons of drama, and not the good kind. OP2 was great though.

<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="382820">
first episodes are pretty decent romance stuff BUT this series is getting so strange at around episode 12 and keeps getting worse...would only recommend it for people who are into: "what is the reason of life" thankfully there is only 1 more episode to go

<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="474117">
The protagonist is a pansy and gets really annoying. Pretty much all the male characters are. The female characters are what makes the show. Especially Koko. More drama than it is a romance. Great ED`s

Recommended for all fans of romance. I only watched till episode 6 and it`s going good. The main guy is interesting since he has memories loss and he tries to find is older self (Spoiler , my bad :&gt; ). Not a waste of time. Btw my first review. (sry if it`s bad)

A very well written love story where the most unlikely of couples face many trials and tribulations related to Banri`s (Male protagonist) amnesia. Will Koko and Banri`s love survive when his memories return? A must see
</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="242627">
There`s something strange about this series. I couldn`t stop myself from watching all 24 episodes in one night, but I ended up feeling some kind of dissatisfaction or deception. There`s a little too much going on (not in complexity but in quantity), and little of it makes any sense. If it kept me glued to the screen, it was for all the wrong reasons - like if I was desperately waiting for something to go the way I wished it to, or for an incredibly clarifying plot twist. In the end, none of that happened and it just ended. But make no mistake, despite its flaws, this is a very memorable series.
</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="165460">
Nothing really new, the protagonist is the pinnacle of the indecisive lead male character of all japanese anime romances, who is counterbalanced by the lead female so the show can keep up a decent pacing. Alas, not a bad show dealing with interesting subjects and how the characters react to said things, while not thoroughly refined it is compelling enough to keep you entretained for the whole 24 episodes. Overall a solid watch, you wont find anything new here but if you want your romance/drama fix, this is for you.
</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="430077">
A pretty good watch overall and the characters are all pretty likeable. If there`s only one thing that bugged me was the whole amnesia thing... and the (imo) exaggerated drama around it. Neverthless, I`d dare say as good as Toradora.
</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="307712">
Golden Time is a superb emotional driven series for freshly new college students. Excellent in most areas and utterly gets awkward in few. But this is what slice of life, daily life, and college life is all about. And it is all about enjoying youth while you`re still young. Golden Time is one of my favorites and the last episode won`t disappoint. I can rest assure that much. Wish there were more episodes like this ... I wish there were more anime similar to this .. We need more college life. We have enough of high school stuff.

Best Slice of life and Romance ive seen in a WHILE ! Forget about the damn haters in this because it is such a feel good anime ! Flipping awesome ! This is not boring but roller coaster ride ! Its kinda like the sweet romance in SAO. Love it Love it. Not a waste of time ! Give this one a try, its not the best but its average and its what i needed after watching 8 harems in a row. My Cravings of love is gone. Thank you

http://anidb.net/ch58576 [Tada Banri] is a newly admitted student at a private law school in Tokyo. Due to the after-effects of an accidental fall from a bridge shortly after high school graduation, he lost all his memories from before then. At the time of the accident, Banri`s soul had escaped from his body, and the Spirit of Tada Banri came into being, carrying his memories from before graduation. Banri finds himself completely lost after the opening ceremony, trying to find his way to the freshman orientation. At that moment, he runs into another lost freshman from the same school, http://anidb.net/ch58574 [Yanagisawa Mitsuo], and they hit it off at once. Somehow arriving at their intended goal just on time, there appears in front of them a beautiful girl holding a bouquet of roses, who hits Mitsuo across the face with them and hands the flowers over to him. This stylish, well dressed, and perfect woman is his childhood friend http://anidb.net/ch58577 [Kaga Kouko]. As children, they had promised to marry each other one day, fulfilling their dreams. In order to escape from her, Mitsuo had gone out secretly and taken the examination for this well-known private college, but she also took the law school entrance examination, catching up with him there. Source: Wikipedia Note: The first episode was pre-aired at a special event on 23.09.2013, regular TV broadcast started on 04.10.2013.

<description>
In traditional belief, a ghost is the soul or spirit of a deceased person or animal that can appear, in visible form or other manifestation, to the living. Descriptions of the apparition of ghosts vary widely: The mode of manifestation can range from an invisible presence to translucent or wispy shapes, to realistic, life-like visions.

<name>amnesia</name>
<description>
The character suffers from some kind of amnesia (memory disturbance or loss). This may mean inability to memorize new information, or inability to recollect old memories. Since there are many types of memory, the person may e.g. forget who they are but still retain learned skills. Amnesia is fairly common in fiction as a plot device. In fact, because it allows for major plot changes while requiring little creativity from the author, it may be subject to heavy overuse.

<description>
Some of the central structural elements in anime are: Plot Continuity How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters? Stereotype Characters Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists. Plot Twists Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.

<description>
Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.

<name>Earth</name>
<description>
The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.

Since college/university students are typically at least eighteen years old, with stories covering mature everyday life topics, you will find the college setting quite often in seinen and josei anime. Topics that can now be covered - as compared to High School settings - are higher education (i.e. coping with higher intellectual stress), the more adult party life (i.e. alcohol, smoking, sex), the issues of daily life vs. studying - especially when having to work to pay for bills, and finally the possible friction between those in and out of college.

<description>
Tokyo, as real-world location is the backdrop of this anime. Tokyo (東京 Tōkyō, "Eastern Capital") is one of the 47 prefectures of Japan. Tokyo is the capital of Japan, the centre of the Greater Tokyo Area, and the largest metropolitan area of the world. It is the seat of the Japanese government and the Imperial Palace, and the home of the Japanese Imperial Family. Tokyo is in the Kantou region on the south-eastern side of the main island Honshu and includes the Izu Islands and Ogasawara Islands. Tokyo Metropolis was formed in 1943 from the merger of the former Tokyo Prefecture (東京府 Tōkyō-fu) and the city of Tokyo (東京市 Tōkyō-shi). (Source: Wikipedia)

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>
Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction). In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today. Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture Source: Wiki

A comedy anime is laced with humour and sets out to provoke laughter from the audience. Japanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.

<description>
The antics of the protagonists do not take place in some exotic setting or time, but in everyday life. When not "at the job" this means getting up in the morning, making meals, house cleaning, going shopping or out to eat, visiting the bath house or spa, leisure activities in the spare time, etc. The time "on the job" for students is School Life, for others working in their profession. Daily Life is basically a synonym for everything normal, repetitive, and trivial happening to your average person.

<description>
Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.

The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics). From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment. Source: Wiki

<name>important haircut</name>
<description>
When a character cuts off his or her hair, it often symbolizes a rite of passage or bout of character growth. A princess striking out on an adventure, or a new recruit at boot camp, for instance. Hair is something that takes time and effort to grow, so parting with it voluntarily can be a powerful act. This is particularly a big deal when women get haircuts. Yet in fiction, even an accidental hair slicing can leave a character with a surprisingly even cut. In many religions (Western Christianity, Ancient Egyptian religion, and others) priests and/or monks cut/shave their hair. Roman Catholic nuns also tend to cut and mantain their hair short under their veils when they enter the nunneries. The cutting of one`s own hair is also a part of Buddhist mythology, specifically something done by Siddhartha himself early on in his path to enlightenment, so anime examples might draw from this as an allusion. There are also some cultures, including Native American and many Asians, where a person would cut his or her hair as an act of grief, disgrace, or even rebellion. In the Confucian tradition, hair (like the rest of your body) is considered a gift from your parents and may not be damaged without a very good reason. Furthermore, prisoners and psychiatric patients commonly have their heads shaved, often to prevent the spread of lice, but sometimes also as a demeaning measure. Source: TVTRope

<name>facial distortion</name>
<description>
The characters face are exaggerated into a misshape, deformed, and almost warped. Used as comedy element to express extreme mood swings. Differing from "http://anidb.net/t2652 [Super Deformed]", here only the face changes to an extreme degree, not the whole body of the protagonist.

<name>flashback</name>
<description>
A flashback is a moment in which someone remembers events from their past. In fiction, flashbacks are used primarily to give insight into a character`s mind or to reveal information which had been previously kept from the audience. They normally consist essentially of new content; in some cases, they may also consist of short snippets of already displayed content, as in http://anidb.net/ch23266 [Okabe Rintarou]`s flashbacks in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate], but even in these cases the flashbacks are used to look into what the character is thinking. As such, they are different from and should not be confused with recaps, which are old content being shown again for no particular purpose other than padding or reminding the audience of the events up to that point. As a rule of thumb, to qualify as a flashback, the scene must advance the show`s content in some way or form; anything else is just a recap.

<description>
And they lived "happily ever after"... *sniff*. All issues in the anime have been resolved, the love polygons sorted out, the conflicts resolved, the guy gets the girl (or the other way around), and everyone else lives on blissfully. (Not very realistic, but then again this is anime.)

<description>
A little bit of the story is found after the credit titles. A little bonus for those patient enough! A sequence at the end of an episode, showing what will happen in the next episode, is NOT a post-credits scene; that is a preview.

<name>beach visit</name>
<description>
Also known as umi episode. Every anime has to have them, episodes in which the characters for whatever reason end up going to the sea, ocean, random island or the local pond. Usually used for fanservice purpose as it gives the staff the opportunity to draw the characters in swimsuits and raise the DVD sales. The cheap version is the http://anidb.net/t6046 [pool episode]. Other marginally less used variants of this are the http://anidb.net/t3444 [onsen episode] and the http://anidb.net/t2830 [furo scene], used when it is too cold for a beach/pool episode. See also http://anidb.net/t2830 [furo scene].

This show features mostly adults. That means children and teenagers are relatively rare and unlikely to hold significance to the plot. That is a rare trait in anime, as most shows spin around children or teenagers.
