This anime had potencial and could have been interesting, if they did the formula of weaker equipped Terrans having to fight a much more powerful foe through the use of their brains and not brawn right. However the execution is sloppy, the character development is next to zero, all the characters are pretty 2 dimensional and story rushed. The animation looks good and the soundtrack is nice, so it has this going for it, if that`s enough to appeal to you, go for it. Otherwise, you`re not missing anything.

First, this show is not a seinen one but shounen. Inaho, the main character is like a cold blooded killer who doesn`t even feel anything even when he thinks he`s just about to die. The antagonists, some retarded haughty noblemen with idiotic mechas (cutting hundreds of incoming bullets per sec with giant jedi swords or launching the mecha`s fists as the only weapon and standing still like a tower, practical and realistic - not) leave no suspense here. The plot is average, the characters are cliched, the dialogues are uninspiring and empty. The music is on the other hand - really nice. Watch this show if you`re a shounen mecha lover or if there`s nothing else to see left, otherwise avoid it.

bleh -- most of the show was disappointing. The characters were bland and underdeveloped, the story was ridiculous and many nice ideas were completely wasted due to their rather lacking presentation. Liked the ending, though

Liked it a lot actually. It was extremely rushed, but if you managed to understand whats going on, you`ll find it enjoyable. idk what else to say. I feel like this was more of a long trailer for the coming up season to get the whole jist of whats going on. I have high expectations for season 2 hopefully i wont be put down.

Another mecha anime with a "smarter than you" protagonist. If you enjoy watching mecha anime where military specialists behave like children and are in turn outsmarted by the protagonist in the most retarded or plot-convenience way, this is the anime for you. Jokes aside, this anime has great story and setting presentation that can keep your suspension of disbelief going full the full ride. The characters are likable and well varied but the protagonist might feel mediocre, if you`ve watched some mecha already. I can`t describe the mecha battles as something other than Ryvius vs GaoGaiGar.

Judging from the three aired eposides, this series is definitely among the best shows this season. The story as well as the characters are interesting - actions are smart and comprehensible, the music is beautiful, the animation art captures the "vibe" of the setting very well. Don`t miss it!

Think we`ve all forgotten what giant robots are for, and no it`s not so the mc can get a next gen gundam and fight one sided battles. Giant robots are built out of necessity to combat other similar threats, and when the war comes yours may not even be a match but when it`s all you`ve got. CG blends well, art direction is decent despite the characters, lovely soundtrack, and the story is nice. Definitely one of the better giant robot shows in the past years, least up till episode 4.

I have only seen up to episode 4. But, I agree with all the comments which have been written so far. In summary, eye-catching animation, good character design, nice story, exciting battles. It is really really good. I like Patlabor, Gundam, etc, but this is really something else in my opinion. I hope they can keep up the good work. It is definitely a must see anime.

masterpiece shoud be at least 24 episode per season

<recommendation type="Must See" uid="561771">
Even though I marked this as a must see, I must admit it is not for everyone. If you are looking for generic mecha action with lots of exciting battles, you`ll probably be disappointed. If you are looking for something completely new (why are you here?) you`ll be disappointed, too. The thing is, A/Z takes many tropes to the extreme, but offers a different view upon them. The MC is OP, but only because he`s able to calmly assess the situation and figure out the enemy`s weaknesses. So even against god-like powers, he always wins, and that`s how the group survives. That doesn`t sound incredibly exciting, so why is it a must? Because it smashes your every expectative. The plot goes in a predictable way just to trick you, and then punches you with a mind-blowing twist that you should have seen coming, but did not. That happens every episode. In that aspect, it`s a lot like Code Geass or Death Note, and I don`t say this lightly (I love those two).

Just finished episode 7. This is good. Too good. I can`t believe how well written the story is. I had little faith in this season because i always judge a book by its cover, but this.......this is epic. And its about damn time we got a main character in an anime that isnt a perv and knows what the hell hes doing. 10/5 stars. Watch it. Now.

At first I expected the typical stacking of "next gen mecha beats enemy -&gt; enemy introduces nextnext gen mecha -&gt; we have to get a nextenxtnext gen mecha -&gt; repeat". Not the case here, at least based on first four episodes. And the way they get out of pinches is not via some deus ex machina. The story seems interesting, the directing is good and the ost is great (especially if you like Sawano Hiroyuki`s work). I have to concur with other recommendations, this is one of the best shows this season.

<description>
Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.

<description>
A robot is an automatically guided machine, able to do tasks on its own. Another common characteristic is that by its appearance or movements, a robot often conveys a sense that it has intent or agency of its own. Not to be confused with android (human-like robot).

<description>
Some of the central structural elements in anime are: Plot Continuity How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters? Stereotype Characters Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists. Plot Twists Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.

<name>target audience</name>
<description>
Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment. The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.

<name>themes</name>
<description>
Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.

The anime will fit this category if some or all of the action takes place on another planet which is supposedly in the same universe as Earth, not a complete fantasy world; usually there has to be some concept of space travel. The Latin name for Earth - Terra, would also pass the condition of being in the same universe as Earth. Basically, even mentioning of Earth existing or having existed would be enough. Although Moon is a moon, it also qualifies as Other Planet.

War is a phenomenon of organized violent conflict, typified by extreme aggression, societal disruption and adaptation, and high mortality. The objective of warfare differs in accord with a group`s role in a conflict: The goals of offensive warfare are typically the submission, assimilation or destruction of another group, while the goals of defensive warfare are simply the repulsion of the offensive force and, often, survival itself. Relative to each other, combatants in warfare are called enemies. The terms military, militant, and militarism each refer to fundamental aspects of war, i.e. the organized group, the combative individual, and the supportive ethos (respectively). Source: wiki

A `mind fuck` is a slang term which describes a work that uses literary devices such as nonlinear storytelling and plot twists in order to present convoluted, yet not conflicting, themes. A creation is usually considered a mind fuck when a casual observer is not able to discern the true meaning of a work without making a serious attempt to unravel the themes presented or when the plot is incredibly difficult to follow. Special examples of mind fucks involve a single plot twist which completely changes the viewer`s understanding of the events in a film or novel as well as the ideas it presents.

<name>translation convention</name>
<description>
When a group of people whose native language is not Japanese (replace with any other language) are together, away from any Japanese speakers, the audience may nonetheless hear them speaking perfect Japanese. This is not a case of translator microbes, in which an in-universe device is performing actual translation: We are meant to assume that the characters are really speaking their own native tongue, and it is being translated purely for our benefit. It is not strictly necessary for there to be no Japanese speakers about; we can sometimes infer from context that they too are speaking a different language. In such cases, it can be difficult (or almost impossible) to tell whether it is the translation convention or translator microbes at work. In some cases, the actors will begin speaking in the characters` native language, then perform a switch-over to Japanese. This is usually accompanied by some sort of camera-move to cue the audience in to the fact that the characters should still be assumed to be speaking in their native language. Also common is characters speaking their own language when addressing Japanese-speaking members of the cast, but accented Japanese at all other times, giving the curious impression that foreigners only speak their own language when they think an Japanese speaker is listening. If done in poor taste, the characters may retain ridiculous accents, resulting in giving the impression that they have no other language. Source: TVTrope
