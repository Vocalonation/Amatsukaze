One of the best anime ever seen A well done combination of action and romance , but in my opinion what really stood out were the feelings and the reality of it I wish I could go to SAO xPPP
</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="195647">
SAO is a potpourri of different genres represented in different qualities and in two parts. Its premise, although cliched, is interesting enough to keep watching the show.Also Characters are likeable and the quality is good. The BIG PROBLEM with this show is, that i has huge time jumps. Especially the first part of the show suffers. Where people want to see development (at least i felt that way) in the purest RPG sense, they are confronted with huge jumps between levels leaving out what could have been interesting. The second part alienates the concept of the whole first part of the show and gives off a different vibe. It also introduces character development, that seems rather deus-ex-machina style. All in all this show is not bad but it should not have been rushed and it should have been seperated into two seasons. Therefore i feel this show is currently overrated by anidb standards. It is still a good watch, but could not make it into the book of greats, unfortunately.

It started off really good, a lot of action, fast-pacing but after some point when they started the second arc it just went downhill and started sucking a lot. I wouldn`t recommend it to someone who is looking for a good dose of entertainment, it`s more of a time-killer anime.

A good anime with a great start, nice characters, fights and interesting story about MMO , but I`m a little disagree with the end and all after first half. It could have been a best anime. For me 7/10.

<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="53032">
1st arc: VASTLY overrated, but still quite good. Despite some nagging plot holes and Mary Sue/Gary Stu moments (especially towards the end of the arc), it`s still easily better than the mediocrity that is its sibling "Accel World". 2nd arc: Pretty much throws away any pretence of actually being set within a real game, recycling the same old cliches you`ve seen in countless shonen series whilst barely attempting to cover them with MMO veneer, repeatedly requires both characters and viewers to be wilfully blind to ignore blatant contrivances and plot holes, down to even an 11th hour literal deus ex machina victory against an utterly one-dimensional antagonist.

As usual the changes made compared to the genial light novels made this anime adaptation an average fantasy. Superfluous additional female characters (all of them cute of course) right at the start made this almost a harem anime. This is totally the opposed to the novels. And also goes against the reality of MMO-s what was an important factor that made this story unique.

Its a pretty good anime overall well at least the first half is, I was actually pretty damn impressed with the first half I loved it for a matter of fact but then things started to get weird after episode 14 they should have just ended it there and then with 3~2 extra aftermath episodes that would have been perfect in my opinion.
</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="117495">
The first 14 episodes are so awesome, I mean the show is out of this world. Then the writers did some drugs, fried their brains and decided to screw the show completly. So if you plan to watch this, go 1-14 and then watch episode 25 as the final episode. Skip 15-24, its not the same show.

The first arch was pretty interesting. The second arch was a bit of a disappointment. Overall a pretty good series.

I was so late, Summer 2014 was when i finally watched it. It came about 2 years before and i didnt even bother with it ! After watching the first half at 3 in the morning i was convinced with tears in my eyes that this is the best anime i have ever seen. But after the second half i was thrown under the bus. Confused as hell this is still a great ass anime !

Nowhere as good as .hack//sign but still a very enjoyable anime till episode 14. I had fun watching it. Just do yourself a favor and stop watching at 14. The second half is extremely bad. It feels like it was written by a different person than the first half.

<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="481279">
A solid watch with a fairly unique storyline and setting, especially for the first season (ep 01-14). The first season has everything to make a great seinen anime: daunting plot, exotic fantasy-world setting, relatable yet powerful protagonist, cute romance, a measure of character development, intense action, and awesome animation & music. The MMORPG setting really adds character to the series that few could pull off; although they didn`t use as much MMORPG jargon as I hoped they would. This anime would be a "must watch" if the last 11 episodes weren`t such a let-down in comparison. While the story-arch in the second season does make sense and continues were the first plot left off romantically, the drama, setting, action, and intensity greatly pale in comparison. So you can watch the last 11 episodes if you want to see where the romance ultimately goes, but if you don`t you`re not missing anything.

Watch it, and be polarized. At least watch it so that you`ll either a) really really like the franchise, or b) really really despise the franchise.

Great animation, lovable characters and a main character who knows he`s strong(he doesn`t discover it by winning battles barely alive). About the ending, well... in my opinion it`s the beginning. The VRMMO`s are shown as a corruption unlike any other. At the end after all they had to endure they still go back, in other words once in you can never click the "log out" button.

SAO was surprisingly good. For one such as me who do not particularly enjoy MMOs this had a crucial plot component which made it much more interesting. Unfortunately the plot took a turn for the worse around episode 14, which dragged it down considerably. To be honest they could have stopped at episode 14, it`s almost like two separate series. 1-14 was amazing, and worth every second, quite possibly the best I have seen in a long time. It`s astounding how close you grew to the characters in such a short time, it was masterful of them to squeeze all that into 14 episodes. Just a pity they didn`t save much for the rest of the series.

<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="56708">
What a great opening story, the premise, the people getting stranded in the virtual world. but yes, the first half is better than the 2nd half. after watching it, i feel it could`ve been done so much better.. still, its almost battle royale-esque in a away, which is the best thing about it (1st half at least)

This is a must see. The plot, the anime, the soundtrack are just awesome. One of my favs of all times. A really good plot that diverges at the half of the show. Some say that the first half it`s what`s really great , but I must say that if you say this you didn`t understand the show at all. This really have it all: action, drama, really deep feelings, present and future, ... a masterpiece... you would really appreciate it as seinen, if you value this as shounen it`s great, but you probably won`t be able to understand all of it

<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="185992">
This anime is enthralling from the start and abruptly loses its momentum mid way than gradually becomes less interesting until the finish line. The pace of this anime is fast which makes for some interesting developments and keeps the show intense. It however causes a setback in the manner where characters and the world dont get as flushed out as well as it could have been. While the latter of the anime was okay it just doesnt reach the quality of attention that the former possessed. There is also a shift of focus and emphasis in the story which could turn away some; transitioning from a survival adventure to heavy doses of romance and drama left and right and continues to expand on those points until the very end. The ending in some ways brought good closure and compensated a little bit for the lackluster second half. If this series only expanded and emphasized the shows strong points it just could have possibly reached greatness.

Great anime, in every aspect from music to animation. It just sucks that there is so little they could do with the story. I felt it had so much more potential with the world than what they did. The ending was meh as well but it is still a must watch, albeit overrated a bit. Still can`t wait for any OVAs or a second season, definitely one of my favorites in a while.

Why was asuna not in the ending there when they were all going to the tower again....wtf is that shit? Great anime cleaned it out in 2 days but why show a dedicated relationship in the real world and then question it in the sense that he was there with his sister and asuna no where to be found..Few questions left in the anime, great concept 9/10 :)!! If they ended this anime on episode 14 or created a new aspect of the first dive 10/10. Still a must see for action/romance. Focuses heavily on both aspects which is VERY hard to find normally heavy action light romance or vice versa. Very balanced must see!

Have to say this is one amazing series. It starts off as yet another .hack// copy / generic fantasy, but quickly builds up into an epic that pulls you in completely. There`s joy, sadness, relief, anger, pure excitement, all bundled into those 25 episodes, intertwining and mixing seamlessly. A tiny spoiler here, the show goes through 3 "phases" that break up any monotony you`d expect from such a long series and each offer a different experience. A good casual watch, but immerse yourself in the world and it becomes a truly wonderful journey.

Not sure what else there is to say than what has already been said, so I`ll just repeat it :D! The story is great, it`s fast paced but doesn`t rush anything, which is rare in itself. There`s a great deal of character development, which I think is why the protagonist is one of my favorite characters, the world changes him bit by bit, but the change isn`t "out of his character", it`s more a case of him maturing a great deal. The animation quality, voice acting, etc. is great as well! I`m adding this to my list of all-time favorites! Even if you aren`t all that interested in MMORPG`s, this is still an anime you can enjoy immensely, because the plot doesn`t focus on the fact that it`s an MMORPG more than necessary, so other than the first episode it`s more of a fantasy story. That being said, if you are familiar with MMORPG`s like myself, you`re going to enjoy it even more ;). In short, give it a try, you won`t regret it!

So many seemingly bad reviews. This anime is just great. It shows how humans adapt to the game scenario, how some even forget what it was like in the real world. I loved the presentation of the characters, each one developing in certain areas, opening a bar, a trade shop, a blacksmith shop and dedicating their efforts to finish the game and return to the real world. What surprised me , and i was almost confident they would leave a huge hole, was the fact that their real bodies must be deteriorating being hooked on IVs in hospitals. They actually point that out also in the anime that a lot of players simply fainted in the game world as an effect. Just brilliant series, and it keeps a good grasp of reality. People waking up from the game experiencing physical handicaps like atrophied muscles and loss of senses.

I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. I came here to leave a simple rating, and noticed the average is over 8, yet the reviews average around a 5. Half the people are angry at it because "it`s unrealistic to go against the programming of a game...." Well. That`s true. But, this is anime, not a documentary. It was wonderfully executed and always exciting to watch. I`d suggest this for everyone.

After the first episode I went and read all the novels. I can tell you so far the show has followed them almost word for word. Only exceptions are to cut down some thing for time constrants which is understandable. The books were brilliant and I loved them, the show is just as good. Its got a great concept and the characters show real impact after events. People are worried about the side stories but if you read the books there is purpose for them at later times. Its not useless fluff fillers like a lot of bleach and naruto that have no bearing on the main story. Give this anime a try, if you like it read the books.

I love the character progression of both the main characters. It does feel a bit rushed with the introduction of new characters to only see them disappear in the next episode, but the events do eventually tie in to the protagonist`s character. Plus, it doesn`t feel like it affects the overall quality of the series unlike other series`. The friendship love story is touching especially in the context of MMORPGs. Definitely looking forward to watching the next episode!

The first half of the anime is really great. It got me hooked quite quickly and it is something different from the regular RPG anime. However, I wish I stopped watching after that first half, because in the second half it became rubbish. There is a strong focus on sexual harrassment which was completely unecessary. It went to an extent that I felt was way too extreme to just be part of telling the story. It really ruined it for me. So if don`t like things like that, I would advise you to stop after episode 14 and maybe watch the last episode.

If they follow the light novels and put it back in chronological order (witch I think they will) then this would be one of the best show of the season as I can`t stop reading the novel already, I can`t wait to see it all in anime.

I think most of us here can actually relate to this series since (I think) most of us here at least had played MMORPG at one point. :p Apart from that, this is actually one of my favourite anime recently because of the storyline and characters + the idea of the game itself. I think the only thing that is quite lack is the depth of each character but its a given since it is only a one season anime. But hopefully though, there`ll be season 2. I watched it twice and still get entertained! :D

This is THE anime of 2012, good animation, story based on light novels (books), also highly recommended to read them as well, anime will have new feeling then

The story lingers in my mind, even several days after having completely watched the series. Seldom that this happens to me. I hope a second series comes out. It`s a pity that they obviously sped up the story in the anime, about halfway the series, compared to the manga, which I haven`t read (yet).

Sword Art Online is such an amazing light novel that I have read. When I first read it I spent about 16 hours straight reading it. And to be able to watch this light novel that struck my being with such a brutal force in an animation, was truly incredible and satisfying. Even though it felt a little rushed through the arcs and some scenes were skipped I`m sorry to say that I`m given this a 10 and Must See. Thank you for animating this wonderful piece!

FIRST: THIS IS NOT HAREM! People who say that can`t tell what is harem or not. Here we have a virtual, RPG like, world much more believable than any other anime that dealt with the theme before. This story is about character development and romance mainly, back off if you want to see amazing apotheotic fights 80% of the time, although there are some cool but short fights to see. Love is the fuel and it`s better developed and fulfilling that any shoujo I have seen recently. SAO is the best anime of the year and it`s better than the light novel it comes from.

Well... I can say that I was a little skeptical about this one when I began to watch it... what a good surprise! First of all, this is a fast passed anime, and thats like GOLD lately, 10 ep and some well developed romance + 4 eps more story development. Maybe I`m just sick of those 12-24 ep animes that are SOOOO slow and with a obviously "kinda" gay and shy main character. Kirito is just... cool. This one is very interesting. Plus, don`t buy that "MMORPG fan" crap...

I`ll probably be repeating the same thing others have said, but this anime is incredible and amazing. Even if you don`t like MMORPGs, you should still watch this. I mean, it is that good!

An excellent series, marred by a sub-par second arc. Fascinating and believable setting with lovable characters including a strong female co-star who doesn`t feel like she exists solely as the main character`s victory prize. Unfortunately, the second arc while still pretty good is nowhere near as excellent as the first for multiple reasons. For me, it`s biggest sin though is that it undoes a lot of what makes several characters interesting in the first arc. Those familiar with the series origin know that original story as it was first conceived was intended to end at the conclusion of the first arc, and it very definitely shows. Still. Highly recommend watching. Despite my dislike of the second arc, the series very quickly ended up in my personal top 5. This is the series you wanted to be watching during .hack Fair warning, SERIOUS sexual assault trigger warnings involved here.

Those of you Gamers that have ever dreamed about being stuck in an actual MMORPG then this show is a must. And those of you who want a good show to watch, then you picked a good one. Though the love story is kinda sporadic, the gameplay and the logic is accurate. You will cry, you will laugh and you will rage while watching this show. This is definitely a show to watch.

Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.

<name>sword</name>
<description>
A sword is a long, edged piece of metal, used as a cutting, thrusting, and clubbing weapon in many civilizations throughout the world. Before firearms became commonplace, and fast enough to render other weapons pointless in the battlefield, they were the main kind of weapon for war and duels alike. A sword fundamentally consists of a blade and a hilt, typically with one or two edges for striking and cutting, and a point for thrusting. That aside, however, they may come in all sorts of designs: the medieval European swords used to be big, heavy weapons that did not actually cut but instead broke the enemy`s bones under their armor; conversely, the Chinese jian sword (called "ken" in Japanese) attempted to exploit the armor`s joints and perforate the enemy`s flesh in those places, but was useless against the armor itself, and did not take the strikes, preferring to redirect them, to this day being considered a highly "circular" weapon and associated to taijiquan; on the other hand, the Japanese katana was a balanced all-purposes weapon that could be used even in an axe-like way, but which a master swordsman could use in many other, more elaborate manners.

The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<description>
Some of the central structural elements in anime are: Plot Continuity How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters? Stereotype Characters Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists. Plot Twists Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.

<name>target audience</name>
<description>
Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment. The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.

<name>themes</name>
<description>
Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>
Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows.

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>
"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR" If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice. It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE. A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime. [Source: TV Tropes]

<description>
Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it. This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.

<description>
A fantasy world is a type of imaginary world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to magic or magical abilities and a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography and sociology, and also on folklore.

<name>Earth</name>
<description>
The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.

<name>nudity</name>
<description>
Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected. People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle. Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic. Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types. Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<name>violent retribution for accidental infringement</name>
<description>
A comedy / slapstick element often found in Ecchi anime: The hilarity derives from spontaneous embarrassment, overreaction of the "victim" (girl), immediate retribution for a seemingly inappropriate act, and a sense of pity with the supposed "aggressor" (boy). Typically a boy will - through no fault of his own - stumble into a girl, thus invading her personal space. In the process the boy may e.g. pull down her skirt, grab the girl`s breasts, or accidentally kiss her. Any level-headed girl would see the accident just for what it is. Not so the girl with an overly developed sense of modesty, and a thing for violence. She - often a tsundere - will clobber the boy with excessive brutality.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>
Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction). In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today. Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture Source: Wiki

<description>
Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.

<description>
The thriller is a genre of fiction in which tough, resourceful, but essentially ordinary heroes are pitted against villains determined to destroy them, their country, or the stability of the free world. The hero of a typical thriller faces danger alone or in the company of a small band of companions. The protagonist may be a law enforcement agent, a journalist, or a soldier, but typically he or she is cut off from the resources of "their" organization. More often the hero is an ordinary citizen drawn into danger and intrigue by circumstances beyond their control. (Source: Wikipedia)

Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results. These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events. A comedy anime is laced with humour and sets out to provoke laughter from the audience. Japanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>
Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi. The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai". The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>harem</name>
<description>
Harem is an entertainment-related trope which is characterized by three or more characters, normally female, who for some reason are in the presence and under the influence of one character, generally male, according to a few genre-defining guidelines; here it will be assumed, for simplicity of language, that the harem lead is a male character and the members are female characters. Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a "http://anidb.net/l511 [reverse harem]", or sometimes also "male harem". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle. As a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well. Most of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called "harem ending".

When the story has been spun so wildly and the plot has been driven so deeply, when all resources are exhausted and the linear truth stands so proudly at the end of the road, ready to bring the never-ending adventure to its epic conclusion... The writers kick you in the behind and say "Screw that!! Suddenly... UFOs!!! No, wait, Werewolf UFOs!!! Bet you didn`t see that coming!" It`s the old-Greek form of solving your broken story because it was too much work to do it all over again, or you`ve already shown stuff that compromises what you wanted to do. It`s finding out about a better dragon on a whole different planet because you`ve already been revived 3 times and that`s the cap. It`s breaking a spaceship and "oh wait, there`s an exact copy built in secret by an unknown guy on the other side of the planet, and you can use it free of charge".

Norse mythology, or Scandinavian mythology, is the body of mythology of the North Germanic people stemming from Norse paganism and continuing after the Christianization of Scandinavia and into the Scandinavian folklore of the modern period. The Norse mythology consists of tales of various deities, beings, and heroes derived from numerous sources from both before and after the pagan period, including medieval manuscripts, archaeological representations, and folk tradition. [...] Most of the surviving mythology centres on the plights of the gods and their interaction with various other beings, such as humanity and the jötnar, beings who may be friends, lovers, foes and/or family members of the gods. The cosmos in Norse mythology consist of Nine Worlds that flank a central cosmological tree, Yggdrasil. Units of time and elements of the cosmology are personified as deities or beings.

The main protagonist of the series. He is the protagonist and is a "solo" player, a player who hasn`t joined a guild and usually works alone. When it is announced that the players of Sword Art Online can no longer logout, he is surprised like everyone else, but unlike everyone else he quickly gets over it and accepts it, to an extent. He mainly uses a one-handed sword and usually wears all black in game, as it adds to stealth. He can also use two blades at once, a unique skill to him and he only uses it in emergencies to avoid attention for being one out of the two people to have unique skills. His game alias is Kirito, which is created by taking the syllables of the first and last Kanji of his real last and first names respectively: (Kirigaya Kazuto). In the real world, he lives with his mother and younger sister in a family of 3.

Originally a side story character in SAO, Yui later becomes an accompanying/support character in ALO. At first thought to be a lost child in SAO, she is actually an artificial intelligence program. Her full designation is «Mental Health - Counselling Program», MHCP version 1, codename, «Yui». She was designed to monitor the emotions of players and appear at their sides to hear and help them out. However, since the moment everyone was imprisoned in Sword Art Online, she was forbidden to come in contact with the players and complete her prime directive. Unable to do anything but suffer as she monitored the emotions of the trapped players, she came upon Kirito and Asuna whose emotions stood out as a beacon of joy and peace in a sea of fear and despair. She sought them out, appearing to them as an amnesia child whom they adopted. In the end she was nearly deleted by Cardinal, the management system of SAO. But Kirito saved her by converting and storing her data into his own Nerve Gear. Yui later shows up in ALO as a Private Navigation Pixie and helps Kirito along with Leafa to find Asuna. She refers to Kirito as "Papa" and Asuna as "Mama" and gets very annoyed if any girl other than Shinon, Leafa or Asuna gets close to Kirito. Source: Wiki

<description>
Nobuyuki Sugou is the main antagonist of the Alfheim Online arc. He is the one responsible for keeping 300 Nerve Gear victims, including Asuna, prisoner even after SAO had ended. He did this by transferring them all into ALO for experiments on human subjugation via fulldive technology. He also attempts to take over RCT Progress Inc. by marrying Asuna while she is unconscious. He displays a perverse interest in consummating this marriage while Asuna is still comatose. In ALO, he takes on the identity of Oberon the Fairy King and makes Asuna his queen, Titania. When he and Kirito finally meet, he flaunts his GM status as well as the results of his research by causing Kirito immense amounts of pain after increasing Kirito`s pain limit and impaling him. He is defeated when the "Ghost Program" of Akihiko Kayaba reminded Kirito how he was defeated by Kirito`s determination, before aiding him in overcoming Nobuyuki`s GM status. All 300 victims are released from ALO, but Nobuyuki makes another attempt to attack Kirito while he is making his way to Asuna in the real world. However, he is once again subdued by Kirito, who puts the unarmed combat skills he had learned in SAO to useful effect. Nobuyuki is then arrested and charged for his crimes. Source: Wiki
