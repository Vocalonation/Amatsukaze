<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="562474">
I would say Maeda`s work is good as always. The only problem is the lack of dramatization which could be compensated by turning it into LN or VN. If you are a fan of Key, this is a must. However, don`t passively watch it. Watch it imaginatively. Otherwise, it would be a really boring 13 episodes for you.
</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="231802">
Interesting idea and concept despite a well used students with super powers theme. Animation and drawing is above average tagged with decent OSTs. Character design is very like-able (Tomori is my fav), filled with many laughter moments. I would say its a very easy watch. And toward the end, it added some plot twist adding a notch of interesting. Highly recommended at 7/10!

Great series! This series does start slow however it gets super good mid to end. I understand some people might be on the edge of watching this but here are some hints on what to expect... powers, survival, powerful male lead, and secret organizations, and very similar to Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei. Watch it now!
</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="166014">
Maeda`s work was good has always, quite unexpected turn of events but that`s what bring out the charm of the creators work. For some reason I didn`t really appreciate the main character at all but that is probably a small detail from me.
</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="94967">
If not for the messed up, contrived and convoluted later episodes, this would have been a must see but alas that did not come to be and it`s just a well animated glimmer of what anime used to be before the current era of mostly self-serving and worst-of-otaku appeasing LN adaptations. Also few of the scenes are not for the feint of heart, you have been warned!
</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="498162">
Didn`t know that it was from Maeda Jun at first, after watching half way, it reminds me Angel Beats! Then, da da.... Man, love this! I totally recommend to everyone who loves Angel Beats!
</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="340292">
Starts off pretty slow, nothing too special but then half way in, the series escalated quick. It made me wonder if i was still watching the same series, the plot develops and turned into an awesome series. Definite Must see :D
</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="661364">original work from maeda jun dont miss it ;-)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="118349">
Charlotte start like an easy-going series, but soon enough you`ll be catapulted in some pretty deep events that will turn out the perception of all that had occurred! Definitely a MUST SEE!
</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="430272">
This series starts off just like you think will and like the descriptions tell you however they take an interesting turn in episode 7 and things get more serious and deeper in meaning and character development! Since I don`t want to ruin anything you just need to watch it. And there is no questions left unanswered so that also is a plus to finish this anime!

<name>extrasensory perception</name>
<description>
Extrasensory perception (ESP), involves reception of information not gained through the recognized physical senses but sensed with the mind. The term was coined by Sir Richard Burton, and adopted by Duke University psychologist J. B. Rhine to denote psychic abilities such as telepathy and clairvoyance, and their trans-temporal operation as precognition or retrocognition. ESP is also sometimes casually referred to as a sixth sense, gut instinct or hunch, which are historical English idioms. The term implies acquisition of information by means external to the basic limiting assumptions of science, such as that organisms can only receive information from the past to the present. In Japanese usage the term is often misappropriated to refer to any supernatural, non-magical, super power. Users of such powers are called `esper` in Japanese. The term `esper` is not normally in use outside of Japan but is slowly being introduced due to its usage in anime and manga. In anime/manga the following powers, among others, are described as ESP: - telepathy - precognition - clairvoyance - retrocognition - remote viewing - aura reading - out-of-body experiences (OBE) - psychokinesis

<description>
Some of the central structural elements in anime are: Plot Continuity How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters? Stereotype Characters Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists. Plot Twists Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.

<description>
Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.

<name>Earth</name>
<description>
The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.

<name>general lack of common sense</name>
<description>
Often a desired backdrop to many anime-comedy series, where most happenings are fast paced and senseless for the pure comical enjoyment of viewers. The lacking of common sense describes a conflicting existence to which some or many people don`t share the majority`s general knowledge of all things, all possible actions and all the logical results of those actions. In spite of a character`s intelligence (although senselessness may suggest some may be lacking average knowledge), most instances receive illogical results or the events themselves are illogical, therefore the events make just as little sense as the results to follow.

In general usage, blackmail is a crime involving unjustified threats against a person or organization in order to make a gain or harm or cause material loss to them unless a demand is met. It may be considered similar to or a form of extortion, although some jurisdictions will consider them as separate crimes. Most often, blackmail involves the threat of revealing some secret to a given third party, which may be another person, a rival organization, or a state institution such as the police, or to the general public. In anime and related media, and more specifically in pornographic works, blackmail is also a device used to coerce people, generally female and often schoolgirls, into having sex with another or others; in such cases, it may be considered similar to or a form of rape.

Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.

The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics). From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment. Source: Wiki

<name>parental abandonment</name>
<description>
In Japan it is a common custom for parents to leave their children alone at home and embark on a lifelong trip around the world once they hit the tender age of 14, sometimes even earlier. Of course this is done because the parents believe their children are independent enough to get their act together. But little do they know about the small secrets their offspring has, such as a childhood fiancé(e) or even a forbidden incestuous love between their (often not-blood-related) children. Of course aside from having a huge house, financial support is provided as well. Usually through the means of MAGICAL MONEY. In rare cases the parents actually die (shortly) before embarking on their world-trip, which is self-evidently used as an important plot device in the development of the child.

<name>gore</name>
<description>
A Splatter film or Gore film is a sub-genre of horror film that deliberately focuses on graphic portrayals of gore and graphic violence. These films, through the use of special effects and excessive blood and guts, tend to display an overt interest in the vulnerability of the human body and the theatricality of its mutilation. Due to their willingness to portray images society might consider shocking, splatter films share some ideological grounds with the transgressive art movement. The term "splatter cinema" was coined by George A. Romero to describe his film Dawn of the Dead, though Dawn of the Dead is generally considered by critics to have higher aspirations, such as social commentary, than to be simply exploitative for its own sake.

<name>secret organisation</name>
<description>
What anime is complete without some group working in the shadows? The organisation may be run by a government, large company or small group depending on their aims. Espionage, political power, world domination, scientific research... so long as the general population is oblivious to their existence they will keep striving for their usually sinister goals.

<name>back to square one</name>
<description>
The story returns to its starting point (or another situation) once or even multiple times. Possible causes for this might be amnesia or time travel. This sometimes leads to the repetition of certain events (like in the "Endless Eight" episodes in Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu (2009)).

<name>sibling yin yang</name>
<description>
In real life, siblings hardly ever act the same. Fiction sometimes takes this to an extreme. Enter Sibling Yin Yang, the occurrence of siblings that are nearly polar opposites. If he`s cool and reckless, she`s responsible and thoughtful. If she`s a spiky-haired hooligan, he`s the nerdy wimpy one. If he`s an immature brat, she`s... well, you get the picture.

<name>absurdly powerful student council</name>
<description>
A student council is a student-managed body inside a school which engages in administrative affairs, usually usually working in a partnership with management, staff and parents, for the benefit of the whole school environment. In real life, a student council holds no actual power; however, in many anime/manga, they have an insane amount of power, which usually allows them to overrule nearly everyone else (the school board, the mayor, the prime minster, you name it). In those cases, that device is explored as a major source of slapstick comedy.

<name>time loop</name>
<description>
A time loop is a common plot device in science fiction (especially in universes where time travel is commonplace). Events in the story repeat themselves a number of times with or without some variation with each pass. Most characters either do not realise this is occurring or are attempting to break the cycle in some way. One well-known example of this is in the 1993 film Groundhog Day, in which the main character is the only one aware of the time loop, although time loops had appeared in many fictional works prior to that. Stories with time loops commonly center on correcting past mistakes or on getting a character to recognise some key truth; escape from the loop may then follow.

<name>heroic sacrifice</name>
<description>
"In order to save the many, the few will need to sacrifice their lives..." or so this character may think. In a seemingly hopeless situation, against impossible odds, the character does not choose the path of the coward and run, he or she chooses to bravely face the enemy, fully aware that this will mean death.

<description>
A trope is a commonly recurring literary and rhetorical devices, motifs or clichés in creative works. This use is a broader redefining of a literary trope, the use of figurative language, via word, phrase, or even an image, for artistic effect, such as using a figure of speech. Source: Wikipedia

<description>
Angel is the student council president at the afterlife school. This places her at odds with the SSS as her responsibilities require her to suppress delinquency and other disruptive activities that the team does. The SSS initially calls her "Angel" since they do not know her real name, but they still refer to her by it even after finding out her real name to be Kanade Tachibana. It is difficult to understand what she is thinking due to her rarely showing any outward emotions. Despite her gentle demeanor and small frame, she is incredibly powerful and near indestructible to the point of ejecting bullets out of her wounds during battle. She creates her powers through a program called Angel Player. She is personally dedicated to helping others overcome their regrets and pass on. She has an affinity for eating mapo doufu, a spicy dish.

Otosaka Yuu is a student of Hoshi no Umi Academy who was forced to join the student council upon being forcefully transferred into it. He has the ability to hijack the bodies of others for five seconds; before enrolling into Hoshi no Umi, he used it to memorize the test answers of better students, to cause fistfights between people he disliked, to get a peek at parts of female bodies usually hidden by cloth, among other pranks. It is later revealed that his true ability is to plunder the abilities of others, and that hijacking people`s bodies is simply the means through which his ability manifests itself.
