<synopsis>
In the year 2022, virtual reality has progressed by leaps and bounds, and a massive online role-playing game called Sword Art Online (SAO) is launched. With the aid of &quot;NerveGear&quot; technology, players can control their avatars within the game using nothing but their own thoughts.<br /> <br /> Kazuto Kirigaya, nicknamed &quot;Kirito,&quot; is among the lucky few enthusiasts who get their hands on the first shipment of the game. He logs in to find himself, with ten-thousand others, in the scenic and elaborate world of Aincrad, one full of fantastic medieval weapons and gruesome monsters. However, in a cruel turn of events, the players soon realize they cannot log out; the game&rsquo;s creator has trapped them in his new world until they complete all one hundred levels of the game.<br /> <br /> In order to escape Aincrad, Kirito will now have to interact and cooperate with his fellow players. Some are allies, while others are foes, like Asuna Yuuki, who commands the leading group attempting to escape from the ruthless game. To make matters worse, Sword Art Online is not all fun and games: if they die in Aincrad, they die in real life. Kirito must adapt to his new reality, fight for his survival, and hopefully break free from his virtual hell.<br /> <br /> [Written by MAL Rewrite]

One year after the SAO incident, Kirito is approached by Seijiro Kikuoka from Japan's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications Department &quot;VR Division&quot; with a rather peculiar request.<br /> <br /> That was an investigation on the &quot;Death Gun&quot; incident that occurred in the gun and steel filled VRMMO called Gun Gale Online (GGO). &quot;Players who are shot by a mysterious avatar with a jet black gun lose their lives even in the real world...&quot; Failing to turn down Kikuoka's bizarre request, Kirito logs in to GGO even though he is not completely convinced that the virtual world could physically affect the real world.<br /> <br /> Kirito wanders in an unfamiliar world in order to gain any clues about the &quot;Death Gun.&quot; Then, a female sniper named Sinon who owns a gigantic &quot;Hecate II&quot; rifle extends Kirito a helping hand. With Sinon's help, Kirito decides to enter the &quot;Bullet of Bullets,&quot; a large tournament to choose the most powerful gunner within the realm of GGO, in hopes to become the target of the &quot;Death Gun&quot; and make direct contact with the mysterious avatar.<br /> <br /> (Source: Crunchyroll)
